Already using ASmallOrange (ASO), which provides shell access to install python, django, etc. Uses MySQL database.


Setup
=====

# Install mysql:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client # installs version 5.5, the same as on ASO
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb  # python mysql bindings
# created jaustin user
# then create quailcam db and user
mysql> CREATE DATABASE quailcam CHARACTER SET utf8;
mysql> CREATE USER 'quailcam'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<redacted>';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON quailcam.* TO 'quailcam'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
# put quailcam user in ~/.my.quailcam.cnf

# install django
# I've already done this on my local box, following whatever basic tutorial they have on their site
# On ASO, I used this tutorial: https://help.asmallorange.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/305/0/installing-django-using-virtualenv

# build django project
# again, just following the tutorials: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/
